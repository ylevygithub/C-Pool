/*
Much like function parameters,
template parameters can have default values.
For instance, let's modify our Pair example from the previous video:
When using the class, users are currently forced
to specify the two types contained in the pair.
If I want to let users only specify one of the two,
and have the other default to a string,
I can do this:
The syntax for specifying the default values
is the same as for function parameters.
If I now want to create a pair with a string as its second type,
I can simply do this.
