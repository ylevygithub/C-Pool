/*
Today's videos will be about the C++ standard library, dubbed STL.
Although it may sound like it at first,
this does not stand for StandarT Library.
The S is for Standard.
The STL follows an ISO standard,
and is designed by a committee that meets regularly
to discuss how the C++ language should evolve.
As a standard, you can be sure to find the STL
with any decent C++ compiler, on any platform.
The STL can be used the same way on Linux, Windows, Mac OS
or any other platform, and should provide the same behavior.
The T is for Template.
The STL is a set of function and class templates,
and can therefore be used in any C++ program,
and adapted to any custom type.
The L is for Library.
The STL is a library of classes and functions
that you can use free-of-charge.
You're borrowing the code, not buying it!
The STL is composed of three main parts:
collections, iterators and algorithms.
In today's videos we will be discussing collections and iterators.
Algorithms will be covered tomorrow.
